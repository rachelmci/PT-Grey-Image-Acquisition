MIT Media Lab - Conformable Decoders

Command line-based script used to acquire images from a setup of multiple PT Grey GigE Blackfly cameras using Flir's
Spinnaker package. Acquisition can be performed through a 'manual' mode (the user clicks to take an image),
a 'timed' mode (the user indicates how many pictures to take and the time between shots), or a 'continuous'
mode (the user enters the number of images to take and the program gathers the images as quickly as possible).
Images are rotated 90 degrees to account for the camera positioning in the physical setup and saved in folders
corresponding to the run's timestamp and the camera number. File naming is compatible for MultiDIC runs. 

Future versions will increase the number of images taken per second in continuous acquisition mode and
implement a GUI.
